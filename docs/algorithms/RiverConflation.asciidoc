==== Feature Definitions

River Conflation defines a river as a linear body of water.

[[RiverMatching]]
==== Matching

River Conflation allows for a manually entered or automatically calculated search radius when 
determining the maximum distance between features to search when attempting matching. Automatic
search radius calculation is achieved via calculated tie points via the rubbersheeting algorithm.

Matching is based off both tag and geometric attributes. For geometry matching, sampled angle 
histogram and a weighted shape distance values are used for comparison. Their match threshold
